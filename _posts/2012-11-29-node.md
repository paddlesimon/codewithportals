# Node

Recently, I've been reading [phuu][]'s articles on [NodeJS][nodejs] in real life. And they're brilliant. If you haven't read them, have a read through [part1](//phuu.net/2012/09/13/node-js-in-real-life-part-1.html) [part2](//phuu.net/2012/09/14/node-js-in-real-life-part-2.html) & [part3](//phuu.net/2012/09/24/node-js-in-real-life-part-3.html). They're all brilliant and have got me hooked on NodeJS.

Now, I was hooked on NodeJS earlier in the year, at the second [Hackathon London](//hackathonlondon.com), but I couldn't get my head around [MongoDB][mongodb] (despite having little booklets with helpful hints and starters into Mongo...) and I knocked up a quicker PHP-MySQL version of the project instead.

Since then, I've gone off NodeJS. I decided that it was something beyond me, and I had more chance winning the lottery than mastering NodeJS.

But after reading [phuu][]'s articles again, I figured it was time for another shot.

And I have a project in mind!

### Pancakes API

You may remember I wrote a quick API for our Android App when I took part in [Angelhack](/2012/11/angelhack/) at the beginning of November. Since I want to move this project on, and get it going, this seems like a reasonable time and a reasonable project to learn NodeJS from!

## Setting everything up

I'm going to be writing the API using [NodeJS][nodejs], [ExpressJS](//expressjs.com) and of course [MongoDB][mongodb].

### Node

Using the knowledge from [phuu][], we run in quick succession:

	# apt-get install mongodb nodejs npm

Next we install `expressjs` globally, as [phuu][] puts it, and while we're at it I might as well install `mongodb` globally too!

> The reason for installing Express globally was to install the useful `express` command line tool that, amongst other things, can create a template application so we can get to work quickly. It has [pretty good documentation](//expressjs.com/guide.html#executable).

	# npm install -g express mongodb mongoose	

And finally, we setup our project:

	# cd /srv/www/nodejs/
	# express --sessions --ejs pancakes-api
	# cd pancakes-api && npm install

This will setup expressjs and the `npm install` configures everything and setups up a lovely starter file in `app.js`.

Next, I made a couple of little changes to `app.js`:

Since the API is going to send and receive in Javascript and JSON, we can make a few changes to `app.js` so it outputs in JSON too! This is done using an `app.use(function() {...})` method.
	
	...
	
	app.configure('development' function() {...});
	
	app.use(function(req, res, next) {
		res.set('Content-Type', 'application/json');
		next();
	});
	
	app.get('/', ...);
	
	...

And I rewrote `routes/index.js` to look like this

	exports.index = function(req, res){
		res.jsonp(200, 'Hello world!');
	};

So that it outputs JSON and JSONP. Even though I've setup `expressjs` to use `ejs` (via the `--ejs` flag), I don't want to use any views. It's an API, not a website!

With everything saved and set, it's time to fire up our app and see if it works.

	# node app

Node will be listening on port `3000`, so a quick visit to `http://dev:3000` (where I've set up a development virtual server) gives me `"Hello world!"`! Progress! And applying `?callback=foo` applys the JSON callback and returns `foo && foo("Hello world!");`

### Apache

The server I'm running off is also running Apache, for my websites (the ones not on [Github](//github.com)) and [Gitlab](//gitlabhq.com), where I host all my private repos. So on my development server I need to get Apache to point a Virtualhost on port `80` to `3000`, without messing with the Apache configuration too much.

After a fair bit of [Google searching](//google.com) and reading through [Stack Overflow](//stackoverflow.com), the answer comes from [another site](//www.dzone.com/snippets/apache2-proxy-local-port) on the web, and it's first comment:

> ### Apache2 Proxy To Local Port
> Apache as the receptionist, forwarding requests to and from an internal server (e.g. webrick or lighttpd).
>
	<VirtualHost *:80>
		ServerName www.example.com
		ProxyPass / http://localhost:3000/
		ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:3000/
		ProxyPreserveHost On
	</VirtualHost>
>
> Change 3000 to whatever port you need and make sure the internal server is set up to answer requests on that port (not port 80). The ProxyPreserveHost line is critical to keep all your URLs working correctly.

And

> Works perfectly.. but, at least on Ubuntu with apache2 you need to sudo a2enmod proxy_http (and maybe a2enmod proxy too!)

Awesome! So real quickly:

	# a2enmod proxy
	# a2enmod proxy_http
	# nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/pancakes.dev
	
	<VirtualHost *:80>
		ServerName api.pancakes.dev
		ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:3000/
		ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:3000/
		ProxyPreserveHost On
	</VirtualHost>
	
	# a2ensite pancakes.dev
	# service apache2 restart

Then a quick edit to `/etc/hosts` to point `api.pancakes.dev` to my virtual development server, and voila! Visiting `api.pancakes.dev` on my Mac reveals:

**Awesome!**

## Writing routes

### An introduction (of sorts)

At the top of `app.js` we have a `require(...)` functions setting stuff up for us. One of which is fairly interesting:

	routes = require('./routes')

This loads `routes/index.js`, which looks like this:

	exports.index = function(req, res){
		res.jsonp(200, 'Hello world!');
	};

This means that if I want to run `exports.index(...)` in `app.js`, I run `routes.index(..)`, since the functions have been exported to the variable (that's probably nowhere near what happens, that's my crazy understanding of it!).

So my `app.js` has a line looking like this:

	app.get('/', routes.index);

So whenever someone visits the root of the API, `routes.index` is run and they get a lovely `Hello world!`! Isn't that nice!

### Our routes

So on this API, I want to visit `/recipe/find` and `recipe/get`. That's the initial endpoints - I'm looking to expand them in the near future!

So let's get started! First off, I've created a file at `routes/recipe.js` and added some empty functions:

	/**
	 *	Recipe page
	 */
	
	exports.find = function(req, res) {
		res.jsonp(200, 'We want to find recipes.');
	};
	
	exports.get = function(req, res) {
		res.jsonp(200, 'We want to get a recipe with an ID of '+req.params.id);
	};

And added some lines to `app.js`:

	// Added a new variable
	var recipe = require('./routes/recipe');
	
	// Added two new routes
	app.get('/recipe/find', recipe.find);
	app.get('/recipe/get/:id', recipe.get);

And time to run it!

	api.pancakes.dev/recipe/find
	"We want to find recipes."
	
	api.pancakes.dev/recipe/get/22
	"We want to get a recipe with an ID of 22"

**Hooray!**

## MongoDB

This is the killer. It isn't really. I'm just new to Mongo!

So, let's get Mongo going!

Earlier, we installed `Mongoose`, a schema-driven database model for MongoDB. All the stuff I'm doing here I've got from [here](//mongoosejs.com/docs/index.html).

Mongoose is very clever. It works by defining a schema, which defines the fields and the types of those fields, and then includes some **very** helpful methods to manipulate Mongo data!

So first up, I've written a `models.js` file, which will include all the schemas and models of each item, so I can use them in my routes:

		
	var mongoose = module.require('mongoose'),
		db       = mongoose.createConnection('mongodb://localhost/pancakes');
	
	RecipeSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
		name: String,
		created: Number,
		time: String,
		tagline: String,
		ingredients: [ String ],
		instructions: String,
		image: String
	});
	
	RecipeSchema.statics.findByIngredients = function(food, callback) {
		this.find({ ingredients: {$in: food} }, callback);
	};
	
	exports.Recipe = db.model('Recipe', RecipeSchema);

So what's here? First off, we get the `mongoose` library, and create a database connection to the database `pancakes`.

Next, we write the schema for a `recipe`, and I've given it some properties.

I've also written a static method for recipes, so they can be found by their ingredients, too!

And finally, the `exports.Recipe = ...` makes the model available to any file that loads this file!

Which is the `routes/recipes.js` file! Right at the top of this file:

	var models = module.require('../models');

So now, every model we create (which in this case is only `Recipe`) we can manipulate MongoDB data for. Pretty sweet if you ask me!
