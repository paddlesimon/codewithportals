# A Project to last my final year

It's the day after "Campus Day", where I returned to Canterbury to have a look at final year modules and final year projects. And it's just dawning on me that I need a solid idea for a final year project.

It's all a little daunting, really. A final year project is going to be an entire year of hard work, for a project that might not even continue to exist after graduation.

So if I am to build something, I want it to last. Like, I really really want it to last.

Whilst I am stuck whilst thinking for ideas, I am not stuck when thinking about technology.

Here are my options for the behind-the-scenes technology for this final year project:

## PHP

Writing a project in PHP is fun. Honestly, I really think it is fun. I love how PHP works, I love how simple PHP is, I don't like how people slag it off even though they totally love Facebook which is built on a PHP-base (at it's heart, of course Facebook have practically rewritten PHP!).

It's also familar. Which is definitely a problem for a final year project.

## Node

NodeJS is awesome. Quite literally, awesome. However the only NodeJS project I've done was an API for an iOS app, which was fantastic, and a frontend website, which was nice. I really really enjoyed working in Node, however debugging it was a pain and generally the learning curve was irratating.
