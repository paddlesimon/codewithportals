# A Fresh Start!

This is one of those weird articles I always write.

> Hello world!

This is a [Jekyll-based](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) blog, hosted on [this Github repo](//github.com/jdrydn/codewithportals). And it also means it is entirely written in **Markdown**!

This was originally a Tumblr-blog. Originally. However, Tumblr seems to be one of these places where it's all [Sherlock](//jdryden.me/post/34106005090) and [Doctor](//jdryden.me/post/34021952128) [Who](//jdryden.me/post/30588525759/the-way-i-see-it-every-life-is-a-pile-of-good) reblogs with a few [Instagram](//jdryden.me/post/32885872630/we-made-pizza-we-made-pizza-taken-with) photos in between. Honestly, it's all just noise.

So I feel I can't have a blog on a social blogging platform. Not really. I wanted this to be proper. *Handwritten*. *Awesome*. *Code-oriented*. *The thoughts of a developer.* So that's what this is!

Written in Markdown, and written in [Mou](//mouapp.com). So the code-highlighting bits are good.

Written in the middle of all the action.

Written. With portals.

Coding. With portals.

Welcome to my blog!
